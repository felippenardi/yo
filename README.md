# Yeoman Dockerfile
## Generating files as non-root

This Docker image gets you ready to go with Yeoman the right way: all generated files are NOT owned by root, so you can edit them outside the docker.

It will attach the current directory as a volume (`/src/`) so any changes made by you or by yeoman are instantly available for both of you.

Most importantly, all files generated by Yeoman will be owned by your own user (not root).
